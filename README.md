Abstract:
In this talk I will discuss different implementations of std::rotate depending
on whether the iterators provided are forward/bidirectional/random-access. I
will also discuss simple application of std::rotate to insertion sort and slide
algorithm. The presentation is derived from Alexander Stepanov's notes on
programming and Sean Parents talk at A9.
